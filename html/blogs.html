              <h4>CATT New Team 2020-2021</h4>
              <p>Oct 26, 2020</p><br>
              <p>The Chinese Association Tricking Team (CATT) recently held their virtual team tryouts for potential new and experienced 
                trickers to join. Based at the University of California, Irvine, CATT is one of the only collegiate 
                tricking teams in the world. Since 2017, they developed a growing presence in the local and even international tricking 
                communities. As of last Tuesday Oct. 26th, they released the roster for the newest generation of members. The 
                tricking community is beyond excited to see what they have in store for the coming year, despite the limitations
                posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4>S . O . B .</h4>
              <p>Aug 30, 2020</p><br>
              <p>Ethan Turner, one of the most well-rounded trickers in the US, is known for embodying pure perfection in nearly 
                all of his tricks. He shows immense skills in his martial arts kicks, his combo transitions, and especially his
                acrobatic twists. Yesterday, he uploaded a new montage on his YouTube channel showcasing his training in the recent months. The 
                video, named <i>S.O.B.</i>, has taken the tricking world by storm. The video editing and music further enhances his already 
                impressive execution of tricks displayed. Once again, Turner continues to develop his already popular image through his 
                talent, and we hope to see more content from him soon.

              <h4>Loopkicks Gathering 2020 Cancelled Due to COVID-19</h4>
              <p>Jun 2, 2020</p><br>
              <p>Loopkicks Gathering is a highly famed tricking gathering known to unite diverse trickers from all over the world to 
                train together and make lifelong connections with each other. Perhaps one of the biggest events of the year, many
                trickers including myself were once again excited for the the gathering which was scheduled to take place from Jul 16, 2020                Jul 19, 2020.
                to Jul 19, 2020. However, we are saddened by the annoucement made by Loopkicks that the event is understandably
                cancelled due to the dangers of the COVID-19 outbreak. This left many attendees to unfortunately reschedule 
                their plans, flights, etc. It is a very hard time for all of us to deal with this pandemic, but health and safety is a 
                priority. Maybe 2021 will be the year that Loopkicks Gathering will return...I hope.
