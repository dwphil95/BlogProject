            <h3><b>PHILIP NGUYEN</b></h3>
            <div id="text-body">
              <p>My name is Philip Nguyen, and I am an ILP trainee for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). I am a recent Computer Science major
                from the University of California, Irvine and have been programming for over 4 years now. My technical 
                background includes languages such as Python, C/C++, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Linux. I strive to be a 
                competent software engineer, and thankfully, TCS has already done an excellent job in propelling my career to that path.<br><br>
                I have also been a martial arts tricker since 2011. I have been in the community for a long time and have even contributed to it by
                 joining and eventually leading the tricking team at my college. The main reason why I got into the sport was that, not only was it 
                 a sport that's not widely known to the general public, but I saw it as an opportunity to build confidence in myself physically and mentally. 
                 It gave me a reason to constantly challenge myself and develop a drive for a really demanding, but rewarding passion.
                 I hope that, some day, the whole world will understand what tricking means to its athletes and that more people
                 will seek to embark on that wild journey, just as I have.
